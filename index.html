    <h2>What Is The Policy Compass Test?</h2>
        <p>The Policy Compass test is based on the <a href="https://github.com/sapplyvalues/sapplyvalues.github.io/">SapplyValues test</a> code with completely new questions of my own making. These questions are similar to those of the original Political Compass test or the Sapply test in many ways and cover similar subjects, but differs in the context of each question.<br /><br /> 
	
	<p>One issue I had with other tests was that it wasn't often clear whether stating "strongly agree" to a statement meant you simply believed that proposition at face value, or whether you wanted the government to make your beliefs law. For example, one could be against homosexuality but still believe that gay people have the right to do what they want in that regard, without facing punishment. So, in this test, I have made it clear that all statements are equal to a proposed bill. Imagine it was an actual bill you get to vote on.<br /><br /> 
	
	<p>You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, as well as a <b>Neutral</b> choice. Each answer slightly affects your scores towards one of the two axes, authoritarian-libertarian and economic left-right. At the end of the quiz, an estimation of your political standing on a political compass will be displayed.<br /><br />
        
        There are 46 questions in the test.</p>
